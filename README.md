## AOD ClockStyles ##
Via this substratum theme you can change the look of the new Beta14 digital clock 2 and typographic clock, which are my favorite. There are 9 different color choices that will affect both clocks.
> Note: This will only work if you are on Beta14 or higher since these clocks don't exist in a lower build.

*Supported Device/OS: OnePlus 7 Pro - Oxygen OS 10 Beta14+ *


**How to apply overlays:**
1. Select the overlay
2. Build and install
3. Reboot
4. Substratum > Manager Tab
5. Select the overlay and swap overlay state
